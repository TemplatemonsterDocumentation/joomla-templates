<h4>Hosting</h4>

<p> As Joomla CMS is a PHP/MySQL based application, you need to prepare a hosting environment to run Joomla first.</p>

<p align="justify"> If you have a live hosting server, please make sure that it matches <a
        href="http://www.joomla.org/technical-requirements.html" target="_blank">Joomla technical requirements</a> and is ready to be used for a Joomla website.</p>

<p align="justify"> You can run Joomla locally  using the local server. To create a local hosting server, please use localhost applications, such as <b>WAMP</b>, <b>AppServ</b>, <b>MAMP</b>, etc. Any of those can be easily installed as any other software and be used to run Joomla.</p>

<p> Please check the tutorials below on how to configure local servers:</p>
