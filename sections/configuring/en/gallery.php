<h4>Adding Images</h4>
<p>To add more images to the gallery you simply need to add new articles to 'Gallery'
    subcategories. Each article should have a full image and an intro image uploaded. Both images are usually placed
    into the 'images/gallery' directory.</p>

<p>An intro image is displayed within the gallery and gallery item views. A full image is displayed once the intro image
    is clicked.</p>

<h4>Adjust layout</h4>
<p>The Gallery page layout can be adjusted as any Joomla category page. Open '<b>Menus > Main
        Menu</b>' section from the Joomla administration panel and edit the Gallery menu item. Switch to the <b>Advanced
        Options</b> tab and you'll get access to the Gallery page settings. </p>

<p>For example if you want to change the number of columns for the Gallery page, change the <b>Columns</b> option from
    the <b>Blog Layout Options</b> settings area. </p>
