<p align="justify">A content management system is software that keeps track of every   piece of content on your Web site, much like your local public library   keeps track of books and stores them. Content can be simple text,   photos, music, video, documents, or just about anything you can think   of. A major advantage of using a CMS is that it requires almost no   technical skill or knowledge to manage. The CMS manages all your   content, so you don't have to. CMS also helps you track your content   easily and help you develop and manage your content in the best possible   way.</p>
